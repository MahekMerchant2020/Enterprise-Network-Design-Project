# Enterprise Network Design Project

This project seeks to design an enterprise network for buildings S2.1 and S2.2 in the School of EEE based on the TCP/IP protocol. The network supports interworking, file sharing, printer
access, and remote networking among workgroups.  

## User Workgroups
– Academic staff (Acad)  
– Administrative staff (Admin)  
– Research students (RS)  
– Lab hosts (Lab)  

## Design Features
– LAN segmentation (and augmentation) of physical networks  
– Network subnetting (and supernetting) of logical networks  
– Design optimization of a layered network  

## Purpose of Access Control Lists
– Host access to networks  
– Interworking of workgroups  
– Group access to shared resources  
– Internetworking of networks  

## Network Design Simulation
– Simulation of network design using Cisco Packet Tracer  
– Implementation of static routing
