# Enterprise Network Design Project

This project seeks to design an enterprise network for buildings S2.1 and S2.2 in the School of EEE based on the TCP/IP protocol. The network supports interworking, file sharing, printer
access, and remote networking among workgroups.  

## User workgroups
– Academic staff (Acad)  
– Administrative staff (Admin)  
– Research students (RS)  
– Lab hosts (Lab)  

## Design features
– LAN segmentation (and augmentation) of physical networks
– Network subnetting (and supernetting) of logical networks
– Design optimization of a layered network

Access control lists for:
– Host access to networks
– Interworking of workgroups
– Group access to shared resources
– Internetworking of networks

Network design simulations
– Simulation of network design using Cisco Packet Tracer
– Implementation of static routing
